# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Car Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about car models, their prices, and fuel efficiency. It includes Python scripts to create both a bar chart and a histogram to visualize the distribution of car prices and fuel efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in the CSV file named `your_dataset.csv`. It includes the following columns:

- `CarModel`: Name of the car model.
- `Price ($)`: Price of the car in dollars.
- `FuelEfficiency`: Fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon (MPG).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (https://www.python.org/)
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
### Usage
- Clone the repository or download the scripts and dataset.
- Place your dataset CSV file in the project directory with the name your_dataset.csv.
- 
### Run the Python script:
```bash
python analyze_cars.py
```
This will generate both a bar chart and a histogram visualizing the distribution of car prices and fuel efficiency.
